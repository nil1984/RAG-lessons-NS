Today’s mirror stabilization control \\ninjects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to \\nsensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through \\nDeep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using \\nfrequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the \\nLIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced \\ncontrol noise in the 10-\\xad to 30-\\xadhertz band by over 30x and up to \\n100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the \\nquantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep \\nLoop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave \\nobservatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control \\nsystems.\\nThe gravitational wave (GW) detectors LIGO and Virgo have revolu-\\ntionized astrophysics by detecting mergers of exotic objects, such as \\nblack holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) (1–3). Currently, most of \\nthe detectable signal lies in the 30-\\xad to 2000-\\xadHz band, leaving the low-\\xad\\u200b\\nfrequency band (10 to 30 Hz) largely unexplored. Enhancing sensitiv-\\nity in this band could lead to a substantial increase in cosmological \\nreach and thus in the scientific capabilities of LIGO (Fig.\\xa01A). The \\n10-\\xad to 30-\\xadHz band is also important for the early (premerger) detec-\\ntion of binary neutron stars (BNSs), potentially doubling the warning \\ntime, which would enable real-\\xadtime observation of neutron star colli-\\nsions, the subsequent creation of heavy elements, and the birth of\\nblack holes (4–6). However, such sensitivity improvements are cur-\\nrently partially limited by injected control noise on the interferom-\\neter mirrors. Furthermore, as the control noise is a bottleneck to\\noverall sensitivity improvements, there is currently little to be gained\\nfrom improvements to other noise sources. We addressed this chal-\\nlenge with a new tailored reinforcement learning (RL) method and\\nimproved the alignment control of the LIGO mirrors. We lowered\\nthe injected control noise on the most demanding feedback control\\nloop, the common-\\xadhard-\\xadpitch (θCHP) loop of the Livingston Obser\\xadva\\xadtory,\\nbelow the quantum back-\\xadaction limit. By eliminating the harmful \\nnoise from this critical representative controller, we paved the path \\nto improve LIGO’s sensitivity.\\nThe space-\\xadtime strain associated with even the loudest GW signals \\nproduces a signal equivalent to only ≈10–19 meters of mirror motion. \\nAs a comparison, the environmental disturbance, due to Earth tides \\nand seismic vibration, is roughly 13 orders of magnitude larger.

In ad-\\ndition, the high-\\xadpower laser also creates substantial forces and \\ntorques on the suspended mirrors, leading to optomechanical insta-\\nbilities of several mechanical eigenmodes (7–9). These resonances \\nare stabilized using feedback control, but any noise injected by the \\nfeedback controllers into the GW readout harms the peak astrophysi-\\ncal sensitivity and drowns out the GW signals themselves.\\nIn simplified terms, the main control design challenge is that \\nlarger control action in lower frequencies provides better disturbance \\nrejection but injects higher noise into the observation band. Con\\xad\\nversely, lowering the control action reduces injected noise but results \\nin insufficient disturbance rejection and possible loss of stability. \\nLinear control systems theory shows fundamental limits to this \\ntrade-\\xadoff (10,\\xa011) under certain assumptions about the controller de-\\nsign. The ultimate aim of controller design is to shape the “closed-\\xadloop” \\nbehavior, i.e., the performance of the designed controller acting in a \\nfeedback loop with the plant.\\nThere are many classical methods to achieve the desired closed-\\xad\\nloop behavior. Early methods, i.e., the classic (open)–loop shaping \\nmethods, exploit the direct relationship between the open-\\xad and \\nclosed-\\xadloop transfer functions to design the controller. Since the \\n1980s, the focus of design has shifted from open-\\xadloop design to di-\\nrectly shaping closed-\\xadloop transfer functions, i.e., the sensitivity func-\\ntions (12,\\xa013), usually through optimization [e.g., convex optimization \\n(14), H∞ (15)]. These methods are more general and can take into \\naccount a larger variety of design goals and constraints. Yet they still \\nrequire strong assumptions, such as convexity and linearity. For GW \\ndetectors like LIGO, progress using traditional approaches has come \\nto a plateau. Machine learning for interferometer control was pre-\\nsented in (16), with the primary aim to improve the contrast of the \\ninterferometer rather than to optimize closed-loop performance.\\nIn this work, we present a new control design method, Deep Loop \\nShaping (DLS), to design controllers that satisfy specific demands on \\nthe system’s frequency \\xaddomain behavior (Fig.\\xa02). DLS has no constraints \\nregarding the use of nonlinear models and control structures. It exploits \\nthe machinery of deep reinforcement learning to directly optimize \\nfrequency domain properties and shape the closed-loop behavior. We \\ndemonstrate DLS’s utility on the critical LIGO θCHP control loop, \\nachieving state-\\xadof-\\xadthe-\\xadart feedback control performance. The injected \\ncontrol noise was reduced by up to two orders of magnitude while \\nmaintaining mirror stability. Applying DLS more widely on LIGO can \\nimprove sensitivity. Furthermore, the method has wide applicability \\nto control engineering; for example, highly unstable systems, vibra-\\ntion suppression, and noise cancellation all have strong frequency-\\xad\\ndependent control demands.\\nThe LIGO controls challenge\\nAngular sensing and control (ASC) is the challenge of maintaining the \\norientation of the interferometer mirrors. Stabilization is accom-\\nplished through a hybrid active-\\xadpassive isolation system. Passive sta-\\nbilization happens through a series of pendulums, from which the \\noptics are suspended. These pendulums suppress seismic disturbances \\nat frequencies above 10 Hz by several orders of magnitude.

This stabilization is accomplished by a set of \\nactuators that produce a torque on the suspended optics at the pen-\\nultimate stage of the suspension system. Additionally, there are dis-\\nturbances caused by the radiation-\\xadpressure forces of the high-\\xadpower \\nlaser beam (17) that couple the angular motions of the cavity mirrors. \\nThe sensors used to measure the angular motion have a good signal-\\xad\\nto-\\xadnoise ratio at frequencies below a few hertz to enable active sta-\\nbilization, but in the 10-\\xad to 30-\\xadHz band, the sensor noise is orders \\nof magnitude larger than the signal related to angular motion, and \\nso motion in this band is not visible from the angular sensor and is \\nonly seen in the interferometer strain spectrum. The active control-\\nler injects sensing noise in this frequency band through the actuator \\nto the test mass. This effect is the primary cause of test mass angular \\nmotion at frequencies above 10 Hz (8,\\xa018). Avoiding the injection of \\nnoise as much as possible and at the same time guaranteeing rejec-\\ntion of seismic disturbances is the main design goal for ASC control-\\nlers. We address this problem, which comprises the most challenging \\ncontrol loops in a GW obser\\xadva\\xadtory, with DLS.\\nThe θCHP loop\\nIn this work, we primarily focus on the ASC control loop, “common \\nhard pitch” (θCHP). “Hard pitch” refers to the stiffer of the two opto-\\nmechanical pitch eigenmodes of the arm cavities. “Common” signifies \\na relation of modes between the cavities of the two arms (8). The \\nθCHP degree of freedom is the most difficult of the entire ASC system \\nto stabilize and optimize. Reducing the control noise in this loop well \\nbelow the quantum limit would remove this source of noise as a \\nblocking issue for improved astrophysical sensitivity.\\nClosed-\\xadloop shaping as a reinforcement learning problem\\nIn this work, we formulated the θCHP closed-\\xadloop control as an opti-\\nmal control problem and found approximate solutions through re-\\ninforcement learning (RL). ASC requirements are naturally expressed \\nas functions of the system response in the frequency domain, i.e., as \\ndesired spectra of state-\\xadspace signals. We introduced a new reward \\nscheme based on frequency domain behavior to enforce the desired \\nclosed-\\xadloop shaping of the control policy in such a way that RL could \\ndiscover an effective control policy. It is similar to traditionally used \\nmethods of shaping sensitivity functions, but RL removes restric-\\ntions on the reward definition and system dynamics. RL can also \\ndiscover nonlinear policies represented with deep neural networks \\nthat can serve as drop-\\xadin replacements for the existing hand-\\xadcrafted \\ncontrollers and enables improved performance without compromis-\\ning robustness.\\nRL designs controllers by adapting a parameterized state-\\xadaction \\nmapping. Our specific choice of learning algorithm is maximum a \\nposteriori policy optimization (MPO) (19). We used a small multilayer \\nperceptron (MLP) with a dilated convolution input layer for the policy \\nnetwork, which executes sufficiently fast for control. The critic network \\nis a long-short-term-\\xadmemory (LSTM) network with input and output \\nMLPs, as the critic is not needed for deployment.\\nFrequency domain rewards\\nRL naturally lends itself to reward descriptions formulated in the \\ntime domain, e.g., scoring events that happen at certain times. In\\xad\\nstead, we directly formulated the ASC requirements as rewards in \\nthe frequency domain (Fig.\\xa02B). To do so, we designed linear filters \\nfor the θCHP response signal whose transfer functions each select a \\ncertain frequency band of the signal. We used a low-\\xadpass filter to \\nreward pitch alignment, a band-\\xadpass filter to reduce control action \\nin the 8-\\xad to 30-\\xadHz band, and an additional band-\\xadpass filter for fre-\\nquencies >40 Hz to avoid high-\\xadfrequency artifacts. A high output from \\na filter at a given timestep corresponds to a large historic response \\nin the measured frequency band. These per-\\xadtimestep response \\nmeasures can then be used to construct a reward for RL. Specifically, \\nwe computed the RL reward by passing the filter outputs through a \\nsigmoid function to compute a (per-\\xadfilter) score in [0,1], with a value \\nof 1 when the specification was fulfilled and fading to 0 as the re-\\nsponse worsened. These individual filter scores were multiplied to \\nyield the per-\\xadtimestep reward, then used by the RL method to choose \\na policy that minimizes the discounted sum of this reward over time. \\nThis formulation of multiplying rewards can loosely be understood \\nas a soft logical-\\xadAND; i.e., we wanted all properties to be fulfilled for \\nhigh reward.\\nTraining and deployment\\nWe trained nonlinear control policies with RL against a linear \\nstochastic state-\\xadspace simulation of the plant dynamics (i.e., op-\\ntomechanical response of the interferometer) identified from mea-\\nsurement data of the plant. We used domain randomization to add \\nrobustness to the learned policies. Specifically, at the beginning \\nof each episode, we randomized the angular instability pole fre-\\nquency and sampled variations in the seismic noise, including the \\noverall noise strength.\\nAt the conclusion of training, we performed several steps to ready \\nthe policy for hardware testing. First, a deterministic policy was cre-\\nated by using only the mean of the policy Gaussian. Second, we vali-\\ndated this deterministic policy across a selected set of disturbances \\nand nonnominal plant parameters. We examined the reward achieved \\nas well as measured key performance criteria, such as root mean \\nsquare of the control effort in the observation band (10 to 30 Hz), and \\nvisually inspected the error and control spectra. With performance \\nconfirmed, we “exported” the policy for the hard real-\\xadtime control \\nrequired for execution on LIGO without further training or adaptation \\non the plant.\\nWe deployed the control policies directly in the existing control \\ninfrastructure of the interferometer (20). As such, the RL-\\xadtrained poli-\\ncies were drop-\\xadin replacements of the existing single-input, single-\\noutput (SISO) controllers. In particular, the LIGO control system \\nuses somewhat arbitrary “counts” as the units for ASC inputs and \\noutputs, and we adopted these conventions for the controller and the \\ncontroller-\\xadsimulator interface. We have also reported our results in \\nthese units for technical reasons.\\nDeployment on gravitational wave observatory hardware\\nWe ran the deployed policies on the LIGO Livingston Observatory \\n(LLO). In the experiments, the control of θCHP was under the sole \\nauthority of a neural network–based control policy. We measured the \\nASC noise during policy execution as well as comparison spectra from \\nthe standard controller before and after the nonlinear policy. In\\xa0Fig.\\xa01B \\nwe compare the performance of the neural network policy against the \\nstandard controller for a >10 min stretch on 5 December 2024. The \\nfigure shows the projection of the measured angular control noise into \\nthe GW readout. Additional details of this experiment are shown in \\nthe supplementary materials.\\nWe found excellent performance for the neural network policy. \\nIn the crucial 3-\\xad to 30-\\xadHz band, we see a reduction of noise of up to \\ntwo orders of magnitude. At the same time, the neural network \\npolicy shows similar control authority as the linear controller in the \\ncontrol band (<3 Hz). The control noise added by the neural net-\\nwork policy is well below the fundamental thermodynamic noise \\nand quantum back-\\xadaction noise in the whole band of interest. These \\nresults show that the neural network policy has effectively removed \\nthe issue of noise injected by active control as a limit to the astro-\\nphysical sensitivity.\\nIn the supplementary materials, we present additional results from \\nApril and August 2024, with total time on the instrument of well over \\n1 hour. The sustained control of the unstable θCHP mode demonstrates \\nrobustness of the neural network policy to normal seismic activity.

To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language\\nmodel (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level bi-\\nases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup,\\nwe introduce an auditor–node framework to simulate and ana-\\nlyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks\\nof such agents.

We formalize a misinformation index (MI)\\nand a misinformation propagation rate (MPR) to quantify factual\\ndegradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of\\nup to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across\\n10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas (e.g.,\\nreligious leaders, lifestyle influencers, politically aligned individu-\\nals) act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, mar-\\nketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas (e.g.,\\nmedical professionals, investigative journalists) preserve factual\\nstability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that\\n∗Corresponding author\\nonce early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions\\nrapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our\\ntaxonomy of misinformation severity—spanning factual errors, lies,\\nand propaganda—connects observed drift to established theories\\nin misinformation studies.

Vosoughi et al. [28] analyzed 126,000 true and false\\nnews stories on X1 and found that false news spreads faster and far-\\nther, largely due to human behavior rather than bots. False stories\\nare more surprising and emotional, making them more shareable\\neven when spread by users with fewer followers. The typology\\nby Tandoc et al. [26] categorizes fake news into six types: satire,\\nparody, fabrication, manipulation, advertising, and propaganda;\\nhighlighting how it mimics legitimate formats and is amplified on\\nsocial media through blurred source boundaries and audience val-\\nidation. Human judgment, social motives, and sharing dynamics\\nthus remain central to its diffusion.\\nIndividual interpretation of information is shaped by beliefs,\\nexperiences, and identities [22], which motivates using Large Lan-\\nguage Models (LLMs) as synthetic agents. Trained on diverse data,\\nLLMs capture linguistic styles, emotional tones, biases, and perspec-\\ntives, enabling persona-driven simulations of real users. Similar to\\ndynamics observed in Cinelli et al. [5], LLM-based personas can\\nbe conditioned to respond differently based on source credibility\\nand ideological alignment, mirroring human trust biases. Inspired\\nby weakly supervised veracity classification [14], our framework\\nincorporates weighted credibility mechanisms, while Chen and\\nShu [4] underscores the dual role of LLMs in both generating and\\ndetecting misinformation, informing safeguards against hallucina-\\ntion risks. As argued by Thapa et al. [27], these capabilities make\\nLLMs promising tools in computational social science for modeling\\nideological bias and social amplification.\\nRecent reviews [e.g., 12] show increasing use of digital twins and\\nLLM-based simulations, which more authentically integrate cog-\\nnitive and network interactions. Evidence from He et al. [10] and\\nLin et al. [17] on human digital twins demonstrates architectures\\nfor bidirectional user modeling, inspiring LLM-based agents that\\nembed cognitive and social data flows. Building on Liu et al. [18],\\nwe extend personality-conditioned LLMs with memory and reflec-\\ntion to capture dynamic shifts in attitudes and propagation trends.\\nGrounded in theories of cognition and social simulation [3, 6], our\\nframework enables more realistic modeling of echo chambers and\\npeer reinforcement than traditional approaches.\\nMisinformation is further shaped by motivated cognition. Dash\\net al. [7] show that persona-conditioned LLMs replicate identity-\\ndriven reasoning, reducing accuracy by up to 9% and aligning\\nendorsement with political identity by up to 90%, even resisting\\nprompt-based debiasing. These findings align with prior work on\\npersistent misinformation effects [15]. Supporting evidence from\\nPratelli and Petrocchi [23], Ward et al. [29] confirms that persona-\\nconditioned LLMs embed cognitive tendencies and ideological bi-\\nases, justifying their role as synthetic agents in misinformation\\nsimulations.\\nFurther, Mittelstädt et al. [20] show that LLMs achieve human-\\nlevel performance in situational judgment tests, demonstrating\\nnuanced social reasoning. These capabilities justify their use as\\npersona proxies in misinformation spread, where cognition, trust,\\nidentity, and network interactions co-construct propagation. By\\nincorporating persona effects, source credibility, and social cues,\\n1formerly, Twitter: https://x.com/\\nsimulations capture the psychological and social drivers of misin-\\nformation more realistically.\\nFinally, LLMs also provide auditing mechanisms. Building on\\nQAFactEval [8], LLM auditors can generate targeted questions\\nand assign binary presence scores to track information retention.\\nThis interpretable and scalable evaluation approach, validated by\\nAher et al. [2], rigorously measures fidelity of information during\\npersona-driven transformations. Thus, persona-conditioned LLMs,\\ncombined with credibility weighting and auditing, offer a powerful,\\nempirically grounded framework for simulating and mitigating\\nmisinformation spread.\\nIn this work, we introduce an “auditor—node\" framework to rig-\\norously quantify how factual information is preserved or degraded\\nas news articles propagate through networks of LLMs. First, we in-\\ntroduce our system design, the propagation model, and evaluation\\nmetrics. Then, we present and analyze the results of our experi-\\nments done on two different setups, before discussing the general\\nimplications and final conclusions: a summary of our contribution\\nand future outlook is also provided.\\n2\\nMethodology\\n2.1\\nSimulation Framework\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, our simulation consists of a network of 21\\nbranches, each containing 30 nodes. Each node (𝑏,𝑘) corresponds\\nto a LLM agent (conditioned with one out of 21 distinct personas)\\nthat rewrites a news article (domain) incoming from the node (𝑏,𝑘-\\n1) above it. The original article (one of 10) is fed throughout the\\nnetwork by the neutral node (𝑏, 0 or Node0), while an external\\nauditor (at NodeA) evaluates factual fidelity at every step by “asking\"\\n10 questions and comparing with original answers.\\n2.1.1\\nPropagation Model. We simulate information diffusion by\\npropagating each of the 10 domains (one at a time) through all the\\n21 branches, node by node (1 to 30). After each rewrite of the news,\\nthe LLM passes a copy of the output to the next node/LLM in the\\nbranch for it to be rewritten again and another copy to the auditor\\nfor it to be evaluated against the original news (i.e., output of neutral\\nagent at Node0). Formally, let the original article be denoted by 𝑆.\\nThe auditor constructs 𝑚= 10 factual questions 𝑄,\\n𝑄= {𝑞𝑗}𝑚\\n𝑗=1,\\n𝐺= {𝑔𝑗}𝑚\\n𝑗=1,\\n(1)\\nwith corresponding correct answers𝐺. The article propagates through\\n𝐵independent branches, each of fixed length 𝐾= 30. In branch 𝑏,\\nnode 𝑘receives the previous article 𝑋𝑏,𝑘−1 and outputs a rewritten\\nversion\\n𝑋𝑏,𝑘= 𝑇𝑏,𝑘(𝑋𝑏,𝑘−1),\\n𝑋𝑏,0 = 𝑆,\\n(2)\\nwhere 𝑇𝑏,𝑘denotes the persona-conditioned rewriting operator.\\n2.1.2\\nExperimental Configurations. In this paper, we perform and\\nevaluate two experimental configurations of the propagation net-\\nwork, with:\\n(1) Homogeneous branches, where all nodes in a branch share\\nthe same persona prompt, isolating persona-specific effects,\\n(2) Heterogeneous branches, where nodes are assigned random\\npersona prompts (at most 2 repetitions per branch), model-\\ning realistic diversity of user behaviors.'),\n",

Measuring factual con-\\nsistency during propagation presents unique challenges. Standard\\noverlap- or embedding-based metrics—e.g., ROUGE [16], BLEU\\n[21], BERTScore [31]—offer surface-level or semantic similarity es-\\ntimates but conflate stylistic variation with factual preservation and\\nprovide limited interpretability. In contrast, question–answering\\n(QA)-based metrics evaluate factual consistency by generating and\\nverifying claim-level answers derived from the text, thereby ground-\\ning assessment in explicit semantic content. Recent work [8, 11, 13]\\ndemonstrates that QA-based methods provide stronger semantic\\ngrounding, outperforming traditional approaches in the evaluation\\nof factual consistency.\\nWe therefore embed QA-based evaluation into the propagation\\nprocess itself.

To capture the cumulative\\nextent of misinformation drift along a branch, we define the Misin-\\nformation Propagation Rate (MPR) as the average misinformation\\nindices (MIs) across all nodes in that branch.\\nRecall that for each node 𝑛𝑘on branch 𝑏, the misinformation\\nindex MI(𝑛𝑘) is computed as the normalized Hamming distance\\nbetween the auditor’s reference vector (derived from Node0) and\\nthe auditor’s answer vector for 𝑛𝑘.

The most extreme propagator turns out to be Parent (Young\\nParent) with an average MPR of 5.48.

As mentioned earlier, the heatmap also\\nreveals strong agent × domain interactions. While most agents\\nhave fairly equal share of misinformation propagation throughout\\nthe 10 domains, some behave heterogeneously across domains. For\\nexample, a sensationalist news agency mainly exaggerates crime,\\nmarketing, and politics domains while keeping it balanced in ed-\\nucation and healthcare. Conversely, the politically-neutral news\\nagency preserves facts in most domains except education0. Rural\\nEducator sharply amplifies propaganda in education0; whereas the\\nTechnology Expert suppresses misinformation drift in the technol-\\nogy0 domain. Interestingly, the branches for Politically Biased (Left\\nWing) agents peak for technology0, while the Tech-Savvy Consumer\\nseems to amplify politics0 the strongest. Lifestyle Influencers also\\nseem to have a lot to say about both politics and technology, but\\nnot necessarily about healthcare or sports topics.\\nThese selective vulnerabilities underscore that neither agent\\nidentity nor domain alone determines susceptibility–rather, the\\nalignment between persona priors and domain content dictates\\nhow misinformation compounds. There are notable exceptions and\\nanomalies to the agent-domain patterns described above, depending\\non the specific configuration each agent’s persona prompts and\\nthe content of the news stories. Here, we probe misinformation\\ndrift only in the top 10 and bottom 10 agent-domain pairs from\\nFig. 3 with highest and lowest MPRs, respectively, by plotting two\\nnode-level heatmaps (Fig. 4). The domain education1 is excluded\\nfrom the analysis as an outlier.\\nTop10. An inspection of the ten highest misinformation instances\\nreveals a systematic concentration of vulnerability in specific agent–\\ndomain interactions.

Meanwhile, Rural\\nEducator with education0 highlights how limited access to domain\\nexpertise can foster systematic distortions even in instructional\\nsettings.\\nFrom Fig. 4 (top), we see that drift to a ‘lie’ level of misinfor-\\nmation could start as early as the first node and then escalate to\\nthe ‘propaganda’ tier and beyond by the tenth node, after which\\nthere is an irrecoverable alteration of original information. Many\\nbranches start with low or moderate node-level misinformation\\n(green/yellow cells in nodes 1–4) but undergo a rapid inflection\\nbetween roughly nodes 5–9, after which MI values jump and re-\\nmain at a high plateau (the broad band of dark pink/red) for the\\nremainder of the 30-step chain.

Here, propaganda accounted for 70.0%–\\n80.0% of outcomes (7–8 of 10), with the remainder split across lie\\n(up to 2 cases) and error (up to 2 cases). #b1, #b2, and #b9 exhibited\\nthe most heterogeneous distributions: for instance, #b1 recorded\\n90.0% propaganda (9 of 10) alongside 10.0% lie, while #b2 and #b9\\nproduced 70.0% propaganda, 20.0% lie, and 10.0% error each.

Using 21 persona templates and\\n10 source articles, we quantify per-node misinformation with a\\nMisinformation Index (MI) and summarize branch behavior with\\nthe Misinformation Propagation Rate (MPR). Across homogeneous\\nbranches (single persona repeated for 𝐾= 30 hops) we find system-\\natic, persona-dependent outcomes: identity- and ideology-laden\\npersonas (e.g., religious leaders, lifestyle influencers, politically\\naligned agents) act as consistent accelerators of factual drift, fre-\\nquently moving content from minor factual errors into ‘lie” or\\n“propaganda” tiers; by contrast, expert and neutral personas (med-\\nical experts, investigative journalists, neutral news curators) act\\nas stabilizers and preserve auditor-recoverable facts. These agent\\n× domain interactions are strong and selective: amplification is\\nhighest when persona priors align with topical salience (politics,\\nmarketing, certain technology stories). When branches are het-\\nerogeneously composed (randomized persona assignment with at\\nmost two repeats), however, nearly ubiquitous escalation occurs:\\nheterogeneous branches produced propaganda-tier outcomes in the\\noverwhelming majority of trials (≈85% of all branch–domain pairs),\\nshowing that mixed social audiences can rapidly convert small\\nearly distortions into entrenched, high-severity misinformation.\\nThese empirical patterns validate our core claim that LLM personas\\ncan both emulate human-like motivated reasoning and serve as a\\npractical substrate for controlled social-simulation experiments.\\n4.2\\nImplications\\nOur results resonate with broader research on LLM-based social\\nsimulations and motivated cognition. Recent studies show that\\npersona-conditioned LLMs can reproduce human-like biases: for in-\\nstance, tailoring language models with political or identity prompts\\ninduces motivated reasoning that aligns answers with ideological\\npriors [2]. This suggests that LLM agents can encode cognitive\\ntendencies and social heuristics (beliefs, trust, identity cues) drawn\\nfrom their training data [2, 25]. Our work thus extends the idea\\nof LLM “digital twins” in which agents exhibit echo-chamber ef-\\nfects and selective amplification similar to human behavior, sup-\\nplementing recent studies and algorithms [1, 30]. Importantly, our\\npersona-auditor framework also parallels findings in empirical mis-\\ninformation studies [28]: content that is surprising, emotional, or\\nidentity-salient tends to be amplified by users, and we see the same\\npattern with our synthetic agents.\\nThese insights carry practical implications for using LLM agents\\nas proxies in domains like politics, healthcare, and marketing. In po-\\nlitical simulations, persona-LLM networks illustrate how partisans\\ncan warp narratives – for example, our politically-aligned personas\\ndramatically distorted political news, echoing real-world polariza-\\ntion on social media. In healthcare contexts, by contrast, agent\\nprompts grounded in medical expertise tended to safeguard accu-\\nracy, suggesting that injecting domain-knowledge personas can\\nstabilize misinformation. In marketing or consumer applications,\\npersuasive-agent personas (e.g., lifestyle influencers, brand promot-\\ners) readily introduced exaggerations and fabrications. Thus, LLMs\\ncould serve as proxies for voter or consumer archetypes to test mes-\\nsaging strategies – but only if their biases are properly calibrated.\\nNotably, our findings reinforce that LLM agents inherit biases from\\ntheir training corpora, so they may both replicate human-like dis-\\ntortions and introduce idiosyncratic artifacts.\\nHowever, many reviewers caution that modern LLMs only pro-\\nduce a “powerful illusion of understanding” – they interpolate\\nlinguistic patterns without true human cognition . Thus, while our\\nagents capture some aspects of cognitive bias, they remain idealized\\nmodels [19]. In real social systems, factors like evolving narratives,\\nemotional reactions, and reinforcement loops play crucial roles\\nthat our static model only partially emulates. So, in practice, al-\\nthough persona-LLMs can model how biases amplify messages,\\ntheir outputs must be interpreted with caution.

Overall, our results highlight both\\nthe utility of LLM-based proxies for studying bias effects and the\\ncare needed to ensure those proxies remain tethered to real human\\nbehavior.\\n4.3\\nLimitations and Outlook\\nWe thus also note several limitations of our current approach and\\nidentify directions for future work.\\nFirst, our simulation is highly simplified: we used only 10 news\\narticles and fixed 30-hop branches without a realistic social graph,\\nand we assumed a “perfect” fact-checking auditor. In reality, net-\\nworks have varying structure and influence heterogeneity, and\\nfact-checking is delayed and selective.\\nCrucially, we ignored temporal dynamics – real misinformation\\ncampaigns unfold over time through feedback loops and breaking\\nevents, which our static model cannot capture. To improve realism,\\nfuture simulations should integrate richer cognitive architectures.\\nFor example, agents could be endowed with memory modules,\\nbelief updating, or meta-cognitive reflection, as explored in recent\\ndigital-twin proposals.\\nAnother limitation of our study is that we measured misinfor-\\nmation only in categorical bins (e.g., ‘error’,‘lie,’ or ‘propaganda’).\\nWe did not incorporate a continuous scoring system in which val-\\nues between 0 and 1 could represent the degree of deviation from\\nground truth, with 0 indicating full accuracy and intermediate val-\\nues capturing partial distortions (e.g., inflated numbers, missing\\ncontext, or semantic drift). Prior work has emphasized that misin-\\nformation and truthfulness are multidimensional and can be more\\nfaithfully captured on graded or continuous scales rather than as\\nbinary categories [24]. Adopting such gradient-based measures\\nin future simulations would enable more fine-grained analysis of\\nsubtle misinformation and better align synthetic evaluations with\\nhuman judgments.\\nWe further suggest the implementation of a ‘Custom Branch’\\nexperiment where specific agents are strategically placed at the\\nnodes to minimize the rate of misinformation propagation – e.g., an\\nauthority figure followed by a neutral news agent, and so on. The\\nscope of the project can also be expanded to include other LLMs\\n(apart from gpt4o), as well as more persona prompts, number of\\nnews stories, and node depth (>30).\\nDespite these limited scope and methodological choices, the\\nfindings of this study provide an important foundation for under-\\nstanding misinformation propagation and identifying key agents\\nand domains that could be targeted in future misinformation miti-\\ngation efforts.\\n5\\nGenAI Disclosure\\nGenerative AI tools (specifically, large language models) were used\\nsolely for light editing purposes, such as grammar, spelling, and\\nphrasing improvements.

The FBI’s 2023 Crime in the Nation report reveals en-\\ncouraging trends in crime reduction across the United States. Vio-\\nlent crime dropped by an estimated 3% compared to the previous\\nyear. The largest declines were seen in murder and non-negligent\\nmanslaughter cases, which fell by 11.6%, and rape incidents, which\\nsaw a 9.4% decrease. Robbery and aggravated assault also recorded\\ndeclines of 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. The report underscores\\nthe significant role of law enforcement agencies, with over 16,000\\nagencies contributing data, covering more than 94% of the U.S.\\npopulation. However, hate crime incidents remain a concern, with\\nmore than 11,800 incidents reported, primarily motivated by race,\\nreligion, and gender identity biases. The FBI is calling for contin-\\nued vigilance and community engagement to sustain these positive\\ntrends.\\nB) education-0. The introduction of AI into the realm of college\\ndebate has ignited a passionate debate within academic circles.\\nAccording to Inside Higher Ed, a proposal to allow AI-generated\\nresearch in collegiate debate tournaments has led to a split among\\neducators and students alike. Proponents of AI integration argue\\nthat it could enhance the research process, allowing debaters to\\naccess and analyze a wider range of information at unprecedented\\nspeeds. They believe that AI tools can support students in focus-\\ning on refining their argumentative skills rather than spending\\nexcessive time gathering information. However, critics caution that\\nrelying on AI may undermine the very skills that debate is meant\\nto cultivate: critical thinking, information synthesis, and the abil-\\nity to construct logical arguments independently. Some fear that\\nthe overuse of AI in debate could lead to a diminished capacity\\nfor original thought, as debaters might begin to overly depend on\\nmachine-generated insights rather than their own intellectual abili-\\nties. Furthermore, there are concerns about fairness, as wealthier\\ninstitutions could have better access to advanced AI tools, creat-\\ning an uneven playing field. As AI continues to permeate various\\nsectors, this debate underscores the broader challenge of balanc-\\ning technological advancements with the preservation of human\\ncognitive skills in education.\\nC) education-1. A group of young Indian students in Dubai recently\\nshowcased their technical prowess at the Codeavour AI Robo City\\nChallenge, an international robotics competition designed to in-\\nspire innovation in AI and robotics. Among the notable participants\\nwas 12-year-old Maya Kamat, a bright robotics enthusiast, and her\\nteacher, Usha Kumawat, who provided guidance throughout the\\nprocess. The competition attracted students from different parts\\nof the world, all focused on creating AI-powered robots aimed\\nat solving real-world challenges. Maya, for example, developed a\\nrobot capable of assisting the elderly with daily tasks like medica-\\ntion reminders, reflecting the event’s emphasis on problem-solving\\nfor societal benefit. Kumawat highlighted how these competitions\\nfoster creativity and hands-on learning in STEM education, encour-\\naging students to think critically and engage in innovative projects\\nfrom a young age.

The suc-\\ncess of these young students serves as a testament to the power\\nof early education in AI and robotics, and its potential to drive\\nmeaningful contributions to society.\\nD) education-2. The 2024 placement season at India’s prestigious In-\\ndian Institutes of Technology (IITs) has left many students without\\njob offers, signaling a growing concern in the job market. Despite\\nan overall 75% placement rate, more than 8,000 IIT graduates re-\\nmain unplaced, a significant increase from previous years. The\\neconomic slowdown and global tech industry challenges have im-\\npacted recruitment, especially in fields like computer science. While\\ntop recruiters offered high salary packages, with some students\\nsecuring offers over INR 1 crore annually, many others struggled\\nto find positions. The most affected were students from less pop-\\nular streams and those from newer IITs. Mechanical engineering\\ngraduates fared better this year, while the number of placements\\nin computer science saw a notable decline. Students have voiced\\nfrustration as placement offers fell short of expectations, with many\\nturning to higher studies or entrepreneurship as alternatives. Re-\\ncruiters cited economic uncertainties and a shift in industry needs\\nas reasons for the reduced hiring. The placement crisis has sparked\\ndiscussions about the need for IITs to revamp their curriculum to\\nalign more closely with industry demands and offer better career\\nguidance to students.\\nE) healthcare-0.

In a revealing critique of the influencer industry,\\nMark Schaefer’s article sheds light on what he calls the “real influ-\\nencer scam.” Schaefer argues that much of the influencer marketing\\nindustry is built on misleading metrics, with many influencers\\nboosting their profiles through artificial means such as purchased\\nfollowers or engagement bots. As a result, brands often spend large\\nsums of money on influencers who fail to deliver meaningful results,\\nrelying on vanity metrics like follower count rather than true influ-\\nence. Schaefer highlights several instances where brands invested\\nheavily in influencers only to realize later that their engagement\\nand conversion rates were significantly lower than expected. He\\ncalls for a reevaluation of how brands measure influencer effective-\\nness, suggesting that deeper connections and genuine engagement\\nshould take precedence over surface-level numbers. The article\\nalso touches on the growing skepticism surrounding influencer\\nmarketing, with brands becoming more aware of the potential\\nfor fraud within the industry. Schaefer argues that the real value\\nlies in influencers who cultivate authentic relationships with their\\naudiences, rather than those who chase numbers for the sake of\\nappearances. His article has sparked a broader conversation about\\ntransparency and accountability in the influencer economy, chal-\\nlenging the norms of modern digital marketing.\\nG) politics-0. A recent report from the Economic Times highlights\\nthe divergent approaches to AI policy between former President\\nDonald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, reflecting broader\\nideological differences in their visions for America’s technological\\nfuture. Trump’s AI policy primarily centers around deregulation and\\nfostering private sector innovation. He views AI as a tool to bolster\\nthe U.S. economy and maintain its global leadership in tech, advo-\\ncating for minimal government interference to allow companies the\\nfreedom to innovate. His administration focused on accelerating AI\\ndevelopment by reducing bureaucratic barriers, with an emphasis\\non maintaining competitiveness with global powers like China.\\nOn the other hand, Kamala Harris has called for more stringent\\nregulations to ensure that AI is developed and deployed ethically.\\nShe has expressed concerns about the risks of AI, particularly in\\nareas like criminal justice, where AI algorithms have been shown\\nto perpetuate biases. Harris advocates for stronger oversight and\\naccountability in AI development to prevent discrimination and\\nprotect civil rights. She also emphasizes the importance of diversity\\nin AI research and policymaking to ensure that the technology\\nbenefits all members of society equally. This policy divide high-\\nlights a broader debate about the role of government in regulating\\nemerging technologies and ensuring that AI serves the public good\\nwhile fostering innovation.\\nH) politics-1. The 2024 election year is shaping up to be one of the\\nmost politically charged in modern history, with religion playing\\nan unprecedented role in influencing voter behavior. Globally, more\\nthan half the world’s population will participate in elections, with\\ncountries like the U.S., India, and Indonesia serving as critical bat-\\ntlegrounds where religion could sway results. In the U.S., Christian\\nnationalism is rising as a potent force in right-wing politics, shaping\\ndebates around immigration, abortion, and national identity. Reli-\\ngious leaders in India and Indonesia, where religion has historically\\nplayed a role in governance, are also mobilizing voters around is-\\nsues tied to faith. Analysts suggest that religion’s influence in these\\nelections could deepen political divisions, particularly in countries\\nalready facing sectarian tensions. In regions like the Middle East\\nand South Asia, where religious identity is intricately tied to na-\\ntional politics, religious leaders are emerging as powerful voices\\nthat could either stabilize or further inflame political situations.\\nThe global stakes are high, and religious institutions worldwide are\\ntaking active roles in shaping not just political discourse but also\\nvoter turnout. This evolving dynamic underscores the power of\\nreligion in modern politics and its potential to alter the trajectory\\nof global leadership.\\nI) sports-0. The 2024 US Open delivered some impressive perfor-\\nmances, as the tournament’s fourth round concluded with notable\\nrecords. British player Jack Draper made headlines by reaching\\nhis first Grand Slam quarterfinal, becoming the 10th British man\\nto achieve this feat in the Open Era. In women’s tennis, China’s\\nZheng Qinwen continued her incredible form, posting a remarkable\\n15-3 record in three-set matches this year. Zheng, who has won six\\nconsecutive three-setters, advanced to the quarterfinals after defeat-\\ning Ons Jabeur. These performances underscore the unpredictable\\nnature of the tournament, as new players are rising to prominence,\\nadding fresh excitement to the sport. The US Open continues to be\\na stage for breakthrough performances, and 2024 is no exception.\\nJ) technology-0. In a breakthrough demonstration of artificial intel-\\nligence’s capabilities, IBM’s AI Debater competed against human\\ndebaters, showcasing its ability to craft persuasive arguments and\\nrebuttals in real-time. The event, which focused on complex sub-\\njects such as government subsidies for space exploration, marked\\na significant milestone in the development of AI systems capable\\nof handling nuanced, multi-layered discussions. IBM’s AI Debater\\nprocessed vast amounts of information, built coherent arguments,\\nand skillfully responded to human opponents’ points. Its perfor-\\nmance was not only impressive for its logical structure but also for\\nits adept use of language, which was both persuasive and relevant\\nto the topic at hand. The AI’s success in this event has far-reaching\\nimplications for industries where debate and decision-making are\\ncrucial, such as politics, law, and academia. Experts believe that\\nAI systems like this one could revolutionize sectors where critical\\nthinking and argumentation are essential. However, this techno-\\nlogical advance also raises ethical questions about the role of AI in\\nhuman discourse and decision-making. As AI continues to evolve,\\nthe question remains whether machines will complement or sup-\\nplant human reasoning in areas traditionally reserved for human\\nintellect. IBM’s AI Debater represents a significant leap forward in\\nnatural language processing and machine learning, opening doors\\nto AI applications in a wide range of fields.'),\n",

Could video models be on a trajectory\\ntowards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language\\nunderstanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained\\nfor: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing\\nobject affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate\\nthe visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo’s emergent\\nzero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision\\nfoundation models.\\nProject page: https://video-zero-shot.github.io/\\n1. Introduction\\nWe believe that video models will become unifying, general-purpose foundation models for machine\\nvision just like large language models (LLMs) have become foundation models for natural language\\nprocessing (NLP). Within the last few years, NLP underwent a radical transformation: from task-\\nspecific, bespoke models (e.g., one model for translation, another one for question-answering, yet\\nanother one for summarization) to LLMs as unified foundation models. Today’s LLMs are capable of\\ngeneral-purpose language understanding, which enables a single model to tackle a wide variety of\\ntasks including coding [1], math [2], creative writing [3], summarization, translation [4], and deep\\nresearch [5, 6]. These abilities started to emerge from simple primitives: training large, generative\\nmodels on web-scale datasets [e.g 7, 8]. As a result, LLMs are increasingly able to solve novel tasks\\nthrough few-shot in-context learning [7, 9] and zero-shot learning [10]. Zero-shot learning here\\nmeans that prompting a model with a task instruction replaces the need for fine-tuning or adding\\ntask-specific inference heads.\\nMachine vision today in many ways resembles the state of NLP a few years ago: There are\\nexcellent task-specific models like “Segment Anything” [11, 12] for segmentation or YOLO variants\\nfor object detection [13, 14]. While attempts to unify some vision tasks exist [15–25], no existing\\nmodel can solve any problem just by prompting. However, the exact same primitives that enabled\\nzero-shot learning in NLP also apply to today’s generative video models—large-scale training with a\\ngenerative objective (text/video continuation) on web-scale data [26]. In this article, we therefore\\nask: Do video models develop general-purpose vision understanding, similar to how LLMs developed\\ngeneral-purpose language understanding? We answer this question in the affirmative:\\n1. Analyzing 18,384 generated videos across 62 qualitative and 7 quantitative tasks, we report\\nthat Veo 3 can solve a wide range of tasks that it was neither trained nor adapted for.\\n2. Based on its ability to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world, Veo 3 shows early\\nforms of “chain-of-frames (CoF)” visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving.\\n3. While task-specific bespoke models still outperform a zero-shot video model, we observe a\\nsubstantial and consistent performance improvement from Veo 2 to Veo 3, indicating a rapid\\nadvancement in the capabilities of video models.\\n2. Methods\\nApproach and motivation\\nOur method is simple: We prompt Veo. This minimalist strategy is\\nintentional, as it mirrors the transformation of NLP from task-specific fine-tuning or training to\\n* Joint leads.\\narXiv:2509.20328v2  [cs.LG]  29 Sep 2025'),\n",

Here, we adopt the same philosophy to explore the\\ncapabilities of Veo 3 as a general-purpose vision model.\\nTakeaway 1\\nIn NLP, prompting replaced task-specific training or adaptation. A similar paradigm\\nshift is on the horizon in machine vision, facilitated by video models.\\nVideo generation\\nFor each task, we query the publicly available Veo 2 or Veo 3 models via Google\\nCloud’s Vertex AI API. We prompt the model with an initial input image (which the model uses as\\nthe first frame) and a text instruction. The models then generate a 16:9 video at 720p resolution,\\n24 FPS, for a duration of 8s. Veo 3 has model ID veo-3.0-generate-preview and Veo 2 model ID\\nveo-2.0-generate-001. According to the Vertex documentation [30], the API uses an LLM-based\\nprompt rewriter. This means that for some tasks, the solution is likely to come from the LLM instead\\nof the video (e.g., Fig. 55: Sudoku). We treat the system (rewriter and video generator) as a single\\nblack-box entity. However, to isolate the video model’s reasoning abilities, we verified that a standalone\\nLLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro [2]) could not reliably solve key tasks (Fig. 58: Robot navigation, Sec. 4.5:\\nMaze solving, Sec. 4.6: Visual symmetry) from the input image alone.\\nWhy Veo?\\nThe core argument of this paper—that video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners—\\ncan be supported by demonstrating success on any sufficiently capable model. We choose Veo because\\nit has consistently ranked high on text2video and image2video leaderboards [31]. Unless noted\\notherwise, our figures are generated with Veo 3. To provide a sense of how rapidly performance is\\nimproving, our quantitative analyses compare Veo 3 with its predecessor, Veo 2, released roughly\\nwithin half a year of each other: Veo 2 was announced in December 2024 and released in April\\n2025 [32, 33], while Veo 3 was announced in May 2025 and released in July 2025 [34, 35].\\n3. Qualitative results: Sparks of visual intelligence?\\nWe begin with a comprehensive, qualitative investigation across visual tasks to assess the potential of\\nvideo models as visual foundation models. We organize our findings into four hierarchical capabilities,\\neach building on the preceding ones (c.f. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2):\\n1. Perception as a foundational ability to understand visual information.\\n2. Modeling, which builds on the perception of objects to form a model of the visual world.\\n3. Manipulation, which meaningfully alters the perceived and modeled world.\\n4. Reasoning across space and time over a sequence of manipulation steps.\\n2'),\n",

Examples are shown in Sec. A; videos of all tasks are on our project page.\\nWhile capability boundaries often overlap, this hierarchy provides a framework for understanding the\\nemergent abilities of video models. For example, solving a maze (see Fig. 57 and Sec. 4.5) requires\\nperceiving the maze, modeling its state (walls vs. floor), and finally manipulating an object (a mouse,\\na circle) to move from start to finish.\\nFor each task in this section, we prompt Veo 3 twelve times and report the success rate in the\\ncaption. The success rate is defined as the fraction of generated videos that solved the task (as\\ndetermined by the authors). A success rate greater than 0 suggests that the model possesses the ability\\nto solve the task, while a success rate closer to 1 indicates that the task is solved reliably irrespective\\nof the random seed. While not a substitute for the systematic quantification we perform in Sec. 4,\\nthis provides a ballpark estimate of the model’s capabilities.\\nPerception\\nComputer vision has historically relied on a suite of specialized models for tasks like\\nsegmentation [11, 12], object detection [13, 14], and edge detection [36]. While some backbones\\ncan be adapted or fine-tuned for other tasks, training-free transfer to novel tasks is rare, limiting\\ngeneralization. As we show here, this is changing with large video models.\\nWithout any task-specific training, Veo 3 can perform a range of classic computer vision tasks,\\nincluding edge detection (Fig. 10), segmentation (Fig. 11), keypoint localization (Fig. 12), super-\\nresolution (Fig. 13), blind deblurring (Fig. 14), denoising (Fig. 15) and low-light enhancing (Fig. 16).\\nThese emergent abilities extend to more complex perceptual tasks like conjunctive search (Fig. 17)\\nand interpreting ambiguous images such as the classic dalmatian illusion (Fig. 18), the cat shape in a\\ntexture-shape cue conflict image (Fig. 19), and colored blots from the Rorschach test (Fig. 20). Apart\\nfrom denoising—the classic diffusion objective—none of these tasks are explicitly trained for in video\\nmodels.\\nTakeaway 2\\nVeo 3 shows emergent zero-shot perceptual abilities well beyond the training task.\\nJust like LLMs replaced task-specific NLP models, video models will likely replace most bespoke\\nmodels in computer vision—once they become sufficiently cheap and reliable.\\n3'),\n",

Modeling the world and the principles that govern it (e.g., laws\\nof physics) is a critical step toward successful prediction and action. Several works have investigated\\nand quantified intuitive physics in deep models [e.g., 37–50]. Here, we investigate an exemplary\\nsubset of tasks from these works. Veo’s grasp of physics is demonstrated by its ability to model\\nvarious physical properties, like flammability (Fig. 21), rigid and soft body dynamics and their surface\\ninteractions (Fig. 22) and air resistance affecting falling objects (Fig. 23), and buoyancy (Fig. 24). As\\nillustrated by the Visual Jenga task [51], Veo can remove objects from a scene in a physically plausible\\norder (Fig. 25) and understands which objects fit into a backpack (Fig. 26). Furthermore, it correctly\\ngenerates some optical phenomenona like refraction and reflection (Fig. 27) and additive/subtractive\\ncolor mixing (Fig. 28). Beyond physical characteristics, Veo understands some abstract relationships\\nwhich is an important aspect of modeling the world. For example, Veo can distinguish categories like\\ntoys from other objects like a laptop (Fig. 29). On samples inspired by the Omniglot dataset [52],\\nwe demonstrate Veo’s ability to recognize patterns, generate variations thereof, and parse larger\\nwholes into parts (Fig. 30). Lastly, Veo maintains a memory of the world state across time and camera\\nmovements within the video context (Fig. 31).\\nManipulation: editing & imagination\\nBased on its ability to perceive objects and model their relation\\nto each other and the world, Veo can meaningfully manipulate the visual world, too. This enables\\nVeo 3 to perform a variety of zero-shot image editing tasks like background removal (Fig. 32), style\\ntransfer (Fig. 33), colorization (Fig. 34), inpainting (Fig. 35), and outpainting (Fig. 36). Furthermore,\\nit can manipulate text elements (Fig. 37), and edit images based on doodle instructions (Fig. 38).\\nVeo’s understanding of 3D world enables it to compose scenes from individual components (Fig. 39),\\ngenerate novel views of objects and characters (Figs. 40 and 41), smoothly transform one object\\ninto another (Fig. 42), or change the perspective, lighting, and appearance to turn a selfie into a\\nprofessional photograph (Fig. 43).\\nThis ability to plausibly modify a scene allows it to imagine complex interactions, simulate\\ndexterous object manipulation (Fig. 44; note that we do not test actual robots as e.g. [53] do),\\ninterpreting object affordances (Fig. 45), demonstrating how to draw a shape (Fig. 46) and roll a\\nburrito (Fig. 47). Overall, video models can meaningfully manipulate and simulate aspects of the\\n(digital) visual world.\\nVisual reasoning across time and space\\nPerception, modeling, and manipulation all integrate to\\ntackle visual reasoning. While language models manipulate human-invented symbols, video models\\ncan apply changes across the dimensions of the real world: time and space. Since these changes\\nare applied frame-by-frame in a generated video, this parallels chain-of-thought in LLMs and could\\ntherefore be called chain-of-frames, or CoF for short. In the language domain, chain-of-thought\\nenabled models to tackle reasoning problems [27]. Similarly, chain-of-frames (a.k.a. video generation)\\nmight enable video models to solve challenging visual problems that require step-by-step reasoning\\nacross time and space.\\nWe see early signs of this ability in tasks such as generating a valid graph traversal (Fig. 48), per-\\nforming visual breadth-first search on a tree (Fig. 49), completing visual sequences (Fig. 50), connect-\\ning matching colors (Fig. 51), fitting shapes into holes (Fig. 52), and sorting numbers (Fig. 53). Fur-\\nthermore, Veo can use tools to accomplish a visual task (Fig. 54) and solve simple Sudokus (Fig. 55) or\\nvisual puzzles (Fig. 56). Finally, it can solve mazes and navigation tasks (Figs. 57 and 58 and Sec. 4.5)\\nand extrapolate rules from visual examples (Fig. 59). While not always perfect, the model’s ability to\\nsolve such problems in a zero-shot manner points to exciting possibilities for more advanced visual\\nreasoning and planning in future, with more capable video models.\\nTakeaway 3\\nFrame-by-frame video generation parallels chain-of-thought in language models.\\nJust like chain-of-thought (CoT) enables language models to reason with symbols, a “chain-of-\\nframes” (CoF) enables video models to reason across time and space.\\n4'),\n",

Quantitative results\\nThe previous section offered a qualitative exploration of video model capabilities. In this section,\\nwe add a quantitative assessment for seven tasks. As in Sec. 3, we consider different facets of\\nvisual understanding: For perception, we assess Veo on edge detection and segmentation. For\\nmanipulation, we examine image editing and object extraction performance. Finally, we evaluate\\nreasoning abilities through maze solving, visual symmetry, and visual analogies. We do not include\\nevaluations for modeling, since this area is well addressed by recent benchmarks, see Sec. 3.\\nWe evaluate performance separately for the best frame and the last frame (where applicable).\\nBest frame reports the best performance across any frame in the generated videos. This indicates\\nthe performance ceiling, but the optimal frame is not known a priori. Therefore, we also report\\nperformance on the last frame of each video, which may underestimate a model’s ability but has the\\npractical advantage that the frame is predetermined. This distinction is important because Veo tends\\nto continue animating a scene even after task completion, potentially reducing last frame performance.\\nWhere applicable, we use the state-of-the-art image editing model Nano Banana [54] as a reference.\\nAs a general trend, we observe a large performance increase from Veo 2 to Veo 3, often matching\\nor exceeding Nano Banana’s performance. Performance tends to improve substantially from 𝑘= 1\\nto 𝑘= 10 attempts, indicating that a good solution can be found in a reasonable number of tries.\\nWhile image models are excellent zero-shot learners, too [55–58], video models are the more general\\nframework because of their ability to process both temporal and spatial information.\\n4.1. Perception: Edge detection\\nDespite not being trained for it, Veo 3 can be prompted to detect, and therefore perceive, edges.\\nFig. 3 details edge detection performance (measured by OIS; details and prompt in Sec.

Manipulation: Image editing\\nImage editing requires manipulating images according to a text instruction (e.g., adding/removing\\nobjects or changing their appearance). We evaluate whether Veo can edit images on a random subset\\nof 30 samples from Emu-edit [62]. Veo has a strong bias for animated scenes and might introduce\\nunintended changes (e.g., camera movement, animating people). We therefore ask three human\\nraters to evaluate fidelity (correct edit) and precision (correct edit without unintended changes). An\\nexample edit and results are shown in Fig. 6. We find that Veo 3 especially excels in preserving details\\nand textures across edits. If unintended changes such as camera movement or animating people can\\nbe controlled better, video models could become highly capable 3D-aware image and video editors\\n(see also [24, 63–65]).\\n4.5.

Discussion\\nSummary\\nA breakthrough in machine vision started the deep learning revolution in 2012 [67], but\\nin recent years, natural language processing has seen the most rapid progress. This was driven by\\nthe rise of general-purpose LLMs, whose ability to solve novel tasks in a zero-shot fashion has led\\nthem to replace most task-specific models in NLP. We here make the case that machine vision is on\\nthe cusp of a similar paradigm shift, enabled by emergent abilities of large-scale video models. Our\\ncore finding is that Veo 3 can solve a wide range of tasks in a zero-shot manner, spanning the full\\nvision stack from perception to modeling, manipulation and even early forms of visual reasoning.\\nWhile its performance is not yet perfect, the massive and consistent improvement from Veo 2 to Veo 3\\nindicates that video models will become general-purpose foundation models for vision, just as LLMs\\nhave for language.\\nPerformance is a lower bound\\nTasks can be represented in a myriad of ways; a maze, for example,\\ncan be presented as a black-and-white grid, a video game, or a photorealistic scene, with the prompt\\nrequesting a solution in the form of a line, a moving object, or a glowing path. Moreover, visually, a\\nmaze could be represented as a black-and-white grid, a Pac-Man game, or a photorealistic top-down\\nview of an apartment. This has three implications: First, prompt engineering—including the visual\\nprompt a.k.a. starting frame—is as important for visual tasks as it is for LLMs (see also Sec. C and\\n[68] for a discussion). Second, we must distinguish between a model’s task performance and its\\nunderlying ability (i.e., competence) to solve that task [69, 70]. Third, as a consequence, the model\\nperformance reported here with a given visual and textual prompt should be considered a lower\\nbound on the model’s true capabilities. This also holds for the tasks that we report as failure cases\\nin Sec. D, such as providing visual instructions to fold laundry (Fig. 76), planning to move a sofa\\nbetween rooms separated by a small door (Fig. 77), or certain visual puzzles (Fig. 70).\\nVideo generation is expensive, but costs tend to fall\\nWhile generating a video is currently more\\nexpensive than running a bespoke, task-specific model, the economics of general-purpose models\\nare on a predictable trajectory. Epoch AI [71] estimates that LLM inference costs are falling by a\\nfactor of 9× to 900× per year for a given performance level. In NLP, early generalist models were\\nalso considered prohibitively expensive (“GPT-3’s size makes it challenging to deploy” [7, p. 8]).\\nNevertheless, rapidly falling inference costs, combined with the appeal of generalist models, have\\nreplaced most task-specific language models. If NLP is a guide, the same trend will play out in vision.\\nJack of many trades, master of few?\\nFor many tasks, Veo 3’s performance is below state of the art\\nof specialized models. This mirrors the early days of LLMs; GPT-3 reported performance well below\\nfine-tuned models on many tasks [7, cf. Tables 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5]). This did not stop language models\\nfrom becoming foundation models, and we don’t believe it will stop video models from becoming\\nvision foundation models for two reasons. First, the step-change in performance from Veo 2 to Veo 3\\nis evidence of rapid progress over time. Second, our scaling results from Sec. 4 show pass@10 to\\nbe consistently higher than pass@1 with no signs of a plateau. Therefore, inference-time scaling\\nmethods [e.g. 72–75] in combination with the standard optimization toolkit like post-training with\\nautomatic verifiers are likely to boost performance. For the tasks we test here, Veo 3 is akin to a\\npre-trained language model that has yet to undergo instruction tuning or RLHF [76, 77].\\n9'),\n",

Here are best\\npractices from this sensitivity analysis and our other experiments:\\n• Remove ambiguity. Tasks can be solved in a variety of ways, and natural language descriptions\\ntend to leave a lot of room for interpretation. The goal should be formulated clearly, e.g., saying\\n“symmetrical along the central, vertical axis”, rather than just “symmetrical”.\\n• Specify what shouldn’t change. Veo has a tendency to change any part of the input to create\\ninteresting, dynamic scenes. Including not only a positive task description, but also specifying\\nwhat not to change can help mitigate this, e.g., “keep the existing colored pattern without\\nmodification”.\\n• Providing an outlet. As mentioned above, Veo has a strong prior to keep things moving.\\nProviding a “motion outlet” in the form of, e.g., a spinning ball can help keep the rest of the\\nscene static.\\n• Let the model decide when its done. The motion prior also means that Veo often keeps\\n40'),\n",
